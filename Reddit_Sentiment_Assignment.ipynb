Detectors on the ground are susceptible to all kinds of interference from the atmosphere — after all, one cloud passing overhead can cause a shiver on an otherwise warm day, but not because the sun itself changed. The best way to detect changes in the output of the sun — versus changes in the radiation reaching the earth’s surface through clouds, smoke, dust, or pollution — is by taking readings from space.\\n\\nThis is a job for satellites. According to PMOD at the World Radiation Center there has been no increase in solar irradiance since at least 1978, when satellite observations began. This means that for the last 40+ years, while the temperature has been rising fastest, the sun has not changed.\\n\\nThere has been work done reconstructing the solar irradiance record over the last century, before satellites were available. According to the Max Planck Institute, where this work is being done, there has been no increase in solar irradiance since around 1940. This reconstruction does show an increase in the first part of the 20th century, which coincides with the warming from around 1900 until the 1940s.

Climate change is unprecedented and it’s truly the greatest test of our humanity. As for our species it has the potential to wipe us out unless we take major action (Including the poor other living creatures :( ). The planet will still exist regardless because we (hopefully) can’t blow it up and physically remove it. It will definitely be inhabitable without question (at least for our type). \\n\\nSorry if this doesn’t make sense but I hope this answers your questions in some capacity and please ask more if this doesn’t convince you!',\n",

This flora is actually what creates breathable air for the landlubbers. Increasing temperature means less oxygen in the water. When this suffocates the organisms responsible for creating breathable O2, you will see a massive collapse of the ecosystem.\\n\\nCO2 is weird because it'll form H2CO3 (carbonic acid) and will dissolve in greater rates and pushes out even more CO2 as the acidification then further dissolves the chalk (CaCO3 - basically sequestered CO2) at the bottom of the ocean. Acidification then causes bleaching of corals and massive changes to the ocean environment. This will further exacerbate the situation. As there's more CO2 in the air, the more it dissolves into the water (Henry's law).\\n\\nWe're parasites in the grand scheme of things and when these ecosystems collapse, that's going to do the true damage. Less arable, farmable land. Less available clean water.  Less hospitable living areas on the planet. Hell, if the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere increases past a certain point, you will not be able to leave your house for very long as you won't be able to breathe the air without getting loopy. 78% N2 / 21% O2 and trace other gases is the composition of the planet.

       " 'For me back in the 2000s when I was reading scientific papers on climate science and trying to figure out whether the arguments of the skeptics held any water, the most convincing evidence for me that global warming was happening and was caused by greenhouse gasses was the scientific data showing that the upper atmosphere of the earth was dramatically cooling.  Here is one article that lays out some of the information:\\n\\n[http://www.theclimateconsensus.com/content/satellite-data-show-a-cooling-trend-in-the-upper-atmosphere-so-much-for-global-warming-right](http://www.theclimateconsensus.com/content/satellite-data-show-a-cooling-trend-in-the-upper-atmosphere-so-much-for-global-warming-right)\\n\\nThe upper atmosphere is cooling dramatically. There is no weather up there to cause fluctuations in temperature and the data is very clear.   The cooling is causing the upper atmosphere to shrink.  NASA noticed that satellites could fly lower without experiencing drag.\\n\\nWhy would a cooling upper atmosphere be evidence of global warming?  Such cooling was a prediction of the scientists who argued that a rising greenhouse effect due to human emissions was warming the earth.  Increasing greenhouse gasses trap heat in the lower atmosphere so there is less heat radiating to space and warming the upper atmosphere.  In the 2000s, many sincere skeptics abandoned their skeptical stance when they saw the data showing a dramatic cooling of the upper atmosphere.\\n\\nIf global warming was caused by the sun, you wouldn\\'t see the lower atmosphere warming while the upper atmosphere was cooling.\\n\\nYou shouldn\\'t get all your information from one side.

As soon as one argument is put to rest, skeptics come up with another \"reason\" why global warming isn\\'t happening, isn\\'t caused by humans, or isn\\'t dangerous.\\n\\nSkeptics arguments change over time because they are not arguing in good faith.   They are looking to cast doubt on the scientific consensus about global warming rather than seeking to understand the scientific evidence.\\n\\nDo you really think scientific institutions all over the globe that have proclaimed that the earth is warming dangerously and that the cause are human emissions of greenhouse gasses are part of a vast left-wing conspiracy?  It\\'s more plausible that the few individuals arguing the on the other side are on the payroll of fossil fuel companies.  Many of them are, in fact, as you noted, indirectly receiving payments from industry.\\n\\nRegarding your concern about whether increasing concentrations of CO2 could cause a an increasing greenhouse effect, consider that a the greenhouse effect due to CO2 is settled science following a paper published in 1969.  See the bottom of this post:\\n\\n[https://skepticalscience.com/basics\\\\_one.html](https://skepticalscience.com/basics_one.html)\\n\\nHow does increasing CO2 cause an increased greenhouse effect when water vapor is so much more important?   CO2 and water work together to create a greenhouse effect because they have different and complementary absorption spectra.  Radiation that would escape through water molecules is blocked by CO2.  Water vapor is like a thick crocheted blanket with holes that let some heat escape.  CO2 is like a thin blanket on top of the thick blanket that traps the heat that would have otherwise escaped.   We\\'re getting into the weeds a little, but here\\'s a paper about this:\\n\\n[https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/wea.2072](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/wea.2072)\\n\\nIncreasing CO2 warms the earth a little.  The little extra warmth increases the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere since warm air holds more water than cold.   The increase in water vapor causes the earth to warm more.  Increasing CO2 causes a positive feedback from water vapor which causes more warming than that due to CO2 alone.\\n\\nScientists have been arguing about how much the earth would warm for a given increase in CO2 (climate sensitivity).  I\\'m not going to try to get into the details.  In recent years the estimates for climate sensitivity have been increasing as more and more warming is measured.  In particular, the oceans are warming dramatically as they absorb most of the heat produced by the increasing greenhouse effect.\\n\\nTry to understand the basics: the increasing greenhouse effect from gasses produced from the combustion of fossil fuels.  And keep in mind that you may lack sufficient science education to understand the more nuanced scientific arguments.  Please trust the scientific institutions of the world.\\n\\nWhat the hell dude.

       " '\"Claim 4: The sun or cosmic rays are much more likely the real causes of global warming. After all, Mars is warming up, too.\\n\\nAstronomical phenomena are obvious natural factors to consider when trying to understand climate, particularly the brightness of the sun and details of Earth\\'s orbit because those seem to have been major drivers of the ice ages and other climate changes before the rise of industrial civilization. Climatologists, therefore, do take them into account in their models. But in defiance of the naysayers who want to chalk the recent warming up to natural cycles, there is insufficient evidence that enough extra solar energy is reaching our planet to account for the observed rise in global temperatures.\\n\\nThe IPCC has noted that between 1750 and 2005, the radiative forcing from the sun increased by 0.12 watt per square meter—less than a tenth of the net forcings from human activities (1.6 W/ m2). The largest uncertainty in that comparison comes from the estimated effects of aerosols in the atmosphere, which can variously shade Earth or warm it. Even granting the maximum uncertainties to these estimates, however, the increase in human influence on climate exceeds that of any solar variation.\\n\\nMoreover, remember that the effect of CO2 and the other greenhouse gases is to amplify the sun\\'s warming. Contrarians looking to pin global warming on the sun can\\'t simply point to any trend in solar radiance: they also need to quantify its effect and explain why CO2 does not consequently become an even more powerful driver of climate change. (And is what weakens the greenhouse effect a necessary consequence of the rising solar influence or an ad hoc corollary added to give the desired result?)\\n\\nContrarians therefore gravitated toward work by Henrik Svensmark of the Technical University of Denmark, who argues that the sun\\'s influence on cosmic rays needs to be considered. Cosmic rays entering the atmosphere help to seed the formation of aerosols and clouds that reflect sunlight. In Svensmark\\'s theory, the high solar magnetic activity over the past 50 years has shielded Earth from cosmic rays and allowed exceptional heating, but now that the sun is more magnetically quiet again, global warming will reverse. Svensmark claims that, in his model, temperature changes correlate better with cosmic-ray levels and solar magnetic activity than with other greenhouse factors.\\n\\nSvensmark\\'s theory failed to persuade most climatologists, however, because of weaknesses in its evidence. In particular, there do not seem to be clear long-term trends in the cosmic-ray influxes or in the clouds that they are supposed to form, and his model does not explain (as greenhouse explanations do) some of the observed patterns in how the world is getting warmer (such as that more of the warming occurs at night). For now, at least, cosmic rays remain a less plausible culprit in climate change.\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nAnd the apparent warming seen on Mars? It is based on a very small base of measurements, so it may not represent a true trend. Too little is yet known about what governs the Martian climate to be sure, but a period when there was a darker surface might have increased the amount of absorbed sunlight and raised temperatures.\"  \\n\\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/7-answers-to-climate-contrarian-nonsense/?fbclid=IwAR2vkrOk0d36Dvl9xPZEfmYqXosawIStSWuJN09x5MXMjrsN0C5SYTtOxJM',\n",

    "### Although this is not formally a bonus for points, it is a learning opportinity.  You are not required to complete the following part of this notebook for the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our sentiment analysis technique above works, but has some shortcomings.  The biggest shortcoming is that each word is treated individually.  But what if we have a sentence with a negation?  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "'This is not a bad thing.'\n",
    "\n",
    "This sentence should be positive overall, but AFINN only has the word 'bad' in the dictionary, and so the sentence gets an overall negative score of -3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most accurate sentiment analysis methods use neural networks to capture context as well as semantics.  The drawback of NNs is they are computationally expensive to train and run.\n",
    "\n",
    "An easier method is to use a slightly-improved sentiment analysis technique, such as TextBlob or VADER (https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) in Python.  Both libraries use a hand-coded algorithm with word scores like AFINN, but also with additions like negation rules (e.g. a word after 'not' has it's score reversed).\n",

    "The stretch goal is to use other sentiment analysis libraries on the Reddit data we collected, and compare the various approaches (AFINN word-by-word, TextBlob, and VADER) using plots and statistics.  For the AFINN word-by-word approach, you will need to either sum up the sentiment scores for each comment, or average them.  You might also divide them by 5 to get the values between -1 and +1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a brief example of getting scores from the 3 methods described above.  We can see while the raw AFINN approach gives a score of -0.6 (if normalized), TextBlob shows 0.35 and VADER shows 0.43."
