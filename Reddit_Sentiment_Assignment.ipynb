For example, an oil or coal power plant producing power for electric cars will be more efficient than thousands of little gasoline engines for cars, but a small population wouldn’t really justify a power plant’s cost so even though they use less fossil fuels overall, it’s still more per person.

The growth in population we see in many poor countries is mostly because women there are not meant or able to have a career therefore their only goal is to have children/marry. 130 Million girls today are denied education and it believed, that a 100% enrollment of girls in all countries could decrease population by nearly 900 million people by 2050.

Most of the pollution comes from wealthy nations from the first world yet developing nations are criticized for growing their economies and their population by using fossil fuels. No one can dictate how much each nation can grow in terms of population. \\n\\nWhat really needs to happen is for the developed world to give developing world the technologies to bypass the use of fossil fuels to grow their economies and to help girls get an education and careers in the developing world. Wealthier families generally have fewer children. This is why there has been a general push to move developing countries out of poverty.

And when you think about it, that reaction makes sense. Many biologists believe that the drive to reproduce is the fundamental force that drives all human activity (all life on Earth, really). It is a hard instinct to turn against.\\n\\nBut really, over time, there is not another option that will yield nearly as much benefit when it comes to slowing global warming. The naysayers in this thread can't argue the simple logic that fewer people on Earth = less energy consumption and reduced Co2 emissions inherently. And frankly, if not for our absolutely massive population boom over the past 200 years, global warming would not be nearly as a big a threat today as it currently is.\\n\\nReally, citizens should be pushing for this to happen now, while they still have some kind of chance at helping to shape the legislation to make this cutback in reproduction as ethical as possible.

When this suffocates the organisms responsible for creating breathable O2, you will see a massive collapse of the ecosystem.\\n\\nCO2 is weird because it'll form H2CO3 (carbonic acid) and will dissolve in greater rates and pushes out even more CO2 as the acidification then further dissolves the chalk (CaCO3 - basically sequestered CO2) at the bottom of the ocean. Acidification then causes bleaching of corals and massive changes to the ocean environment. This will further exacerbate the situation.

There is no weather up there to cause fluctuations in temperature and the data is very clear.   The cooling is causing the upper atmosphere to shrink.  NASA noticed that satellites could fly lower without experiencing drag.\\n\\nWhy would a cooling upper atmosphere be evidence of global warming?  Such cooling was a prediction of the scientists who argued that a rising greenhouse effect due to human emissions was warming the earth.  Increasing greenhouse gasses trap heat in the lower atmosphere so there is less heat radiating to space and warming the upper atmosphere.  In the 2000s, many sincere skeptics abandoned their skeptical stance when they saw the data showing a dramatic cooling of the upper atmosphere.\\n\\nIf global warming was caused by the sun, you wouldn\\'t see the lower atmosphere warming while the upper atmosphere was cooling.\\n\\nYou shouldn\\'t get all your information from one side.

CO2 and water work together to create a greenhouse effect because they have different and complementary absorption spectra.  Radiation that would escape through water molecules is blocked by CO2.  Water vapor is like a thick crocheted blanket with holes that let some heat escape.  CO2 is like a thin blanket on top of the thick blanket that traps the heat that would have otherwise escaped.

The little extra warmth increases the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere since warm air holds more water than cold.   The increase in water vapor causes the earth to warm more.  Increasing CO2 causes a positive feedback from water vapor which causes more warming than that due to CO2 alone.\\n\\nScientists have been arguing about how much the earth would warm for a given increase in CO2 (climate sensitivity).  I\\'m not going to try to get into the details.  In recent years the estimates for climate sensitivity have been increasing as more and more warming is measured.  In particular, the oceans are warming dramatically as they absorb most of the heat produced by the increasing greenhouse effect.\\n\\nTry to understand the basics: the increasing greenhouse effect from gasses produced from the combustion of fossil fuels.

After all, Mars is warming up, too.\\n\\nAstronomical phenomena are obvious natural factors to consider when trying to understand climate, particularly the brightness of the sun and details of Earth\\'s orbit because those seem to have been major drivers of the ice ages and other climate changes before the rise of industrial civilization. Climatologists, therefore, do take them into account in their models. But in defiance of the naysayers who want to chalk the recent warming up to natural cycles, there is insufficient evidence that enough extra solar energy is reaching our planet to account for the observed rise in global temperatures.\\n\\nThe IPCC has noted that between 1750 and 2005, the radiative forcing from the sun increased by 0.12 watt per square meter—less than a tenth of the net forcings from human activities (1.6 W/ m2). The largest uncertainty in that comparison comes from the estimated effects of aerosols in the atmosphere, which can variously shade Earth or warm it. Even granting the maximum uncertainties to these estimates, however, the increase in human influence on climate exceeds that of any solar variation.\\n\\nMoreover, remember that the effect of CO2 and the other greenhouse gases is to amplify the sun\\'s warming. Contrarians looking to pin global warming on the sun can\\'t simply point to any trend in solar radiance: they also need to quantify its effect and explain why CO2 does not consequently become an even more powerful driver of climate change. (And is what weakens the greenhouse effect a necessary consequence of the rising solar influence or an ad hoc corollary added to give the desired result?)\\n\\nContrarians therefore gravitated toward work by Henrik Svensmark of the Technical University of Denmark, who argues that the sun\\'s influence on cosmic rays needs to be considered. Cosmic rays entering the atmosphere help to seed the formation of aerosols and clouds that reflect sunlight. In Svensmark\\'s theory, the high solar magnetic activity over the past 50 years has shielded Earth from cosmic rays and allowed exceptional heating, but now that the sun is more magnetically quiet again, global warming will reverse. Svensmark claims that, in his model, temperature changes correlate better with cosmic-ray levels and solar magnetic activity than with other greenhouse factors.\\n\\nSvensmark\\'s theory failed to persuade most climatologists, however, because of weaknesses in its evidence. In particular, there do not seem to be clear long-term trends in the cosmic-ray influxes or in the clouds that they are supposed to form, and his model does not explain (as greenhouse explanations do) some of the observed patterns in how the world is getting warmer (such as that more of the warming occurs at night). For now, at least, cosmic rays remain a less plausible culprit in climate change.\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nAnd the apparent warming seen on Mars? It is based on a very small base of measurements, so it may not represent a true trend. Too little is yet known about what governs the Martian climate to be sure, but a period when there was a darker surface might have increased the amount of absorbed sunlight and raised temperatures.\"  \\n\\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/7-answers-to-climate-contrarian-nonsense/?fbclid=IwAR2vkrOk0d36Dvl9xPZEfmYqXosawIStSWuJN09x5MXMjrsN0C5SYTtOxJM', 'Solar activity can’t explain the warming since 1950, because [solar inputs haven\\'t been increasing](https://imgur.com/vf3jTHY) during that time.

    "# Stretch goal (bonus-ish)\n",
    "### Although this is not formally a bonus for points, it is a learning opportinity.  You are not required to complete the following part of this notebook for the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our sentiment analysis technique above works, but has some shortcomings.  The biggest shortcoming is that each word is treated individually.  But what if we have a sentence with a negation?  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "'This is not a bad thing.'\n",
    "\n",
    "This sentence should be positive overall, but AFINN only has the word 'bad' in the dictionary, and so the sentence gets an overall negative score of -3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most accurate sentiment analysis methods use neural networks to capture context as well as semantics.  The drawback of NNs is they are computationally expensive to train and run.\n",
    "\n",
    "An easier method is to use a slightly-improved sentiment analysis technique, such as TextBlob or VADER (https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) in Python.  Both libraries use a hand-coded algorithm with word scores like AFINN, but also with additions like negation rules (e.g. a word after 'not' has it's score reversed).\n",
    "\n",
    "Other sentiment analysis libraries in Python can be read about here: https://www.iflexion.com/blog/sentiment-analysis-python\n",
    "\n",
    "### The stretch goal\n",
    "The stretch goal is to use other sentiment analysis libraries on the Reddit data we collected, and compare the various approaches (AFINN word-by-word, TextBlob, and VADER) using plots and statistics.  For the AFINN word-by-word approach, you will need to either sum up the sentiment scores for each comment, or average them.  You might also divide them by 5 to get the values between -1 and +1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a brief example of getting scores from the 3 methods described above.  We can see while the raw AFINN approach gives a score of -0.6 (if normalized), TextBlob shows 0.35 and VADER shows 0.43."
